Orchestrator
============

A module for sequencing and executing tasks and dependencies in maximum concurrency

Usage
-----

### 1. Get a reference:

```javascript
var Orchestrator = require('orchestrator');
var orchestrator = new Orchestrator();
```

### 2. Load it up with stuff to do:

```javascript
orchestrator.task('thing1', function(){
  // do stuff
});
orchestrator.task('thing2', function(){
  // do stuff
});
```

### 3. Run the tasks:

```javascript
orchestrator.run('thing1', 'thing2', function (err, stats) {
  // all done
});
```

API
---

### orchestrator.task(name[, deps][, function]);

Define a task

```javascript
orchestrator.task('thing1', function(){
  // do stuff
});
```

#### name
Type: `String`

The name of the task.

#### deps
Type: `Array`

An array of task names to be executed and completed before your task will run.

```javascript
orchestrator.task('mytask', ['array', 'of', 'task', 'names'], function() {
  // Do stuff
});
```

**Note:** Are your tasks running before the dependencies are complete?  Make sure your dependency tasks
are correctly using the async run hints: take in a callback or return a promise or event stream.

#### fn
Type: `function`

The function that performs the task's operations.  For asynchronous tasks, you need to provide a hint when the task is complete:

- Take in a callback
- Return a stream or a promise

#### examples:

**Accept a callback:**

```javascript
orchestrator.task('thing2', function(callback){
  // do stuff
  callback(err);
});
```

**Return a promise:**

```javascript
var Q = require('q');

orchestrator.task('thing3', function(){
  var deferred = Q.defer();

  // do async stuff
  setTimeout(function () {
    deferred.resolve();
  }, 1);

  return deferred.promise;
});
```

**Return a stream:** (task is marked complete when stream ends)

```javascript
var map = require('map-stream');

orchestrator.task('thing4', function(){
  var stream = map(function (args, cb) {
    cb(null, args);
  });
  // do stream stuff
  return stream;
});
```

**Note:** By default, tasks run with maximum concurrency -- e.g. it launches all the tasks at once and waits for nothing.
If you want to create a series where tasks run in a particular order, you need to do two things:

- give it a hint to tell it when the task is done,
- and give it a hint that a task depends on completion of another.

For these examples, let's presume you have two tasks, "one" and "two" that you specifically want to run in this order:

1. In task "one" you add a hint to tell it when the task is done.  Either take in a callback and call it when you're
done or return a promise or stream that the engine should wait to resolve or end respectively.

2. In task "two" you add a hint telling the engine that it depends on completion of the first task.

So this example would look like this:

```javascript
var Orchestrator = require('orchestrator');
var orchestrator = new Orchestrator();

// takes in a callback so the engine knows when it'll be done
orchestrator.task('one', function (cb) {
    // do stuff -- async or otherwise
    cb(err); // if err is not null and not undefined, the orchestration will stop, and 'two' will not run
});

// identifies a dependent task must be complete before this one begins
orchestrator.task('two', ['one'], function () {
    // task 'one' is done now
});

orchestrator.run('one', 'two');
```

### orchestrator.run(tasks...[, cb]);

Start running the tasks

#### tasks
Type: `String` or `Array` of `String`s

Tasks to be executed. You may pass any number of tasks as individual arguments.

#### cb
Type: `function`: `function (err, stats) {`

Callback to call after run completed.

Passes arguments:

1. `err`: error if orchestration failed

Type: `Object`

For missing tasks, `err` has `missingTasks` array of task names

For recursive dependencies, `err` has `recursiveTasks` array of the recursive task sequence discovered

2. `stats`: Type: `Object`

```javascript
{
  tasks:[], // list of tasks that were queued to run
  message:'succeeded' // a descriptive message
  duration:[] // a process.hrDuration, require('pretty-hrtime') to turn it into words
}
```

**Note:** Orchestrator uses [`async.auto`](https://github.com/caolan/async) to resolve dependencies, so tasks may not run in the specfied order.
Listen to orchestration events to watch task running.

```javascript
orchestrator.run('thing1', 'thing2', 'thing3', 'thing4', function (err, stats) {
  // all done
  console.log('ran '+stats.tasks.join(', ')+' in '+require('pretty-hrTime')(stats.duration));
});
```
```javascript
orchestrator.run(['thing1','thing2'], ['thing3','thing4']);
```

**FRAGILE:** Orchestrator catches exceptions on sync runs to pass to your callback
but doesn't hook to process.uncaughtException so it can't pass those exceptions
to your callback

**FRAGILE:** Orchestrator will ensure each task and each dependency is run once during an orchestration run
even if you specify it to run more than once. (e.g. `orchestrator.run('thing1', 'thing1')`
will only run 'thing1' once.) If you need it to run a task multiple times, call `.run()` a second time.
(e.g. `orchestrator.run('thing1', function () {orchestrator.run('thing1');})`.)
Alternatively create a second orchestrator instance.

**Note:** Orchestrator descends from [`EventEmitter2`](https://github.com/asyncly/EventEmitter2). See EventEmitter2's [docs](https://github.com/asyncly/EventEmitter2) for more event listeners.

### orchestrator.on(event, cb);

Listen to orchestrator events

#### event
Type: `String`

Event name to listen to:
- taskStart: task was started
- taskError: task errored
- taskEnd: task completed

#### cb
Type: `function`: `function (e) {`

Passes single argument: `e`: event details

```javascript
orchestrator.on('tasStart', function (e) {
  // e.message is the log message
  // e.task is the task name if the message applies to a task else `undefined`
  // e.err is the error if event is 'error' else `undefined`
});
// for taskEnd and taskErr:
orchestrator.on('taskEnd', function (e) {
  // e is the same object from task_start
  // e.message is updated to show how the task ended
  // e.duration is the task run duration (in seconds)
});
```
